jumpstart is a command-line tool to create new C# projects from prebuilt/templates.

As experienced developers it's very common we have some kind of template solution when we start a new project. Maybe is the latest project we work on, maybe is a very good template we used all time to start a bootstrap of specific kind of project. I created jumpstart to simplify the process of create the new project based on those templates or prebuilt solutions.

The idea of tool was born a long time ago and became a little stronger every time that I had to create a new project solution and had to create all the solution by hand, but when I saw the message bellow in the [http://xamarin.com/prebuilt](http://xamarin.com/prebuilt ) page I decide to finaly write the tool... and the name was very clear, almost.

> The first name that I thought to the tool was prebuilt, but later my friend [@GiusepeCasagrande](https://github.com/GiusepeCasagrande) convinced me that jumpstart was really better name... and he was right!
